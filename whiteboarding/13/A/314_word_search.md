# Tell me about a time you did something that hadn't been done before

Should take one minute; minute and a half at most

##### Prompt

Say: "Along your career path, I'd like you to tell me about a time you did something that hadn't been done before"

##### Do you hear these things?

- *Identify*: Does the interviewee discuss their competencies based on what you have asked them? Competencies include:
   - Technical Skills (libraries, languages, etc.)
   - Interpersonal Skills  
   - Something related to their programming experience (story should not delve into irrelevant topics)


- *Prove*: Does the interviewee provide a _specific_ example (past experience or hypothetical scenario)  to showcase competencies and/or fit? Is it presented in the form of a story (punchline, beginning, middle, positive end)?


- *Close*: Does the interviewee showcase why the company should hire them and how their skills/experience/values will add value to and align with the team/company? Does the interviewee showcase what they have learned in "Prove" and how they will apply it to the new role?

# 314 - Word Search

Given a `matrix` of characters `a-z` and a `word`, return a boolean as to
whether the word exists in the matrix


```
Input: Matrix of characters from a-z, String word
Output: Boolean as to whether word can be found in matrix
```

# Example
```
Input:

[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
 ['e', 'f', 'g', 'h'],
 ['i', 'd', 'o', 'j'],
 ['k', 'l', 'm', 'n']]

'dog'

Output: true
```
# Constraints
```
Time Complexity: O((N*M)^2) where N is width of matrix, and M is the height
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(N*M)
```

### Notes (Only give if asked; or as tools to help guide interviewee if he/she is stuck)

* There'll be at least one character inside the matrix
* All elements of the matrix will be single characters of lowercase a-z; no capitalized to worry about. Can assume valid input
* Second argument will be at least one character long (can assume valid input here as well)
* Words can be built from adjacent letters (up, down, left, right), but not diagonals. Same character cannot be used multiple times in the same word
* Duplicates can exist inside matrix; duplicates can exist inside target word


# Solution

We will perform depth first search from every cell within the matrix.
As we traverse outwards from each cell, we will use a visited set to
ensure we're not using characters in a word multiple times. As we
travel outwards from each cell, we'll use an index that increments (with
each recursive call) to check if the character we've travelled to matches
with a corresponding character within the target word. If the word is
found, we'll toggle a boolean to be true.

1. Create a `visited` set
2. Create a `wordFound` variable and set it to false
3. Perform a doubly-nested for loop to travel through each cell
   within the matrix
4. From each cell, call the recursive depth-first search function with
   three arguments: `x`, `y`, `index` (index always starts at 0)
   - base case: if index is equal to length of target word, set `wordFound`
     to be true and return
   - base case: if `x` or `y` coordinates are off of the matrix, return
   - base case: if matrix at `x`-`y` coordinates doesn't match the target
     word at the index, return
   - base case: if the `wordFound` is already true (meaning word has already
     been found), return
   - base case: if `x`-`y` coordinate has already been visited, return
   - action: add `x`-`y` coordinate to `visited` set
   - recursive case: travel up, down, left, and right from current position
      - call depth-first search recursively (repeat from step 4)
   - action: remove `x`-`y` coordinate from `visited` set
5. return wordFound at end of function


```javascript
function wordSearch(matrix, target) {
  let visited = new Set();
  let wordFound = false;

  function search(x, y, index) {
    if (index === target.length) {
      wordFound = true;
      return;
    }
    if (y < 0 || x < 0 || y >= matrix.length || x >= matrix[0].length) {
      return;
    }
    if (matrix[y][x] !== target[index]) {
      return;
    }
    if (wordFound) {
      return;
    }
    let key = x + '_' + y;
    if (visited.has(key)) {
      return;
    }

    visited.add(key);
    search(x + 1, y, index + 1);
    search(x - 1, y, index + 1);
    search(x, y + 1, index + 1);
    search(x, y - 1, index + 1);
    visited.delete(key);
  }


  for (let y = 0; y < matrix.length; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < matrix[0].length; x++) {
      search(x, y, 0);
    }
  }

  return wordFound;
};

Input:

matrix = [
 ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
 ['e', 'f', 'g', 'h'],
 ['i', 'd', 'o', 'j'],
 ['k', 'l', 'm', 'n']
]

'dog' -> true
'abcgfd' -> true
'don' -> false

```
